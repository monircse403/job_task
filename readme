1. I first make in interface with constructor sending product catalogue and delivery charge rules true
2. In the class we implement this
 = First I add the product using product code to this function function add ($product_code)
 = second I make the function to calculate total price using function total
 First I loop through the product array how many product order and then get the price from product catalogued array
 For special discount I use the specialOffer true false so that if that is true reduce the price half
 Inside the loop I add each total with delivery charge. For the delivery charge I made seperate function and add this delivery cost with the final total
 to make this as final result.

 I have made two function one for special offer and one for delivery charge


 3. It takes 1:45hr for me to make hope this will help.

 I push the code to git and here is the repository
